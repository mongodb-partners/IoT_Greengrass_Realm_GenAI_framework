# Fleet mobile app

This React Native application enables users to manage their assigned jobs. The app is powered by Realm Device Sync https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/react-native/sync-data/configure-a-synced-realm/] for real-time synchronization of jobs.


This project is bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### pods install 

```sh
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### node module install

```sh
# using yarn
yarn install
```



### Step 1: Start the Metro Server


First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```sh
# using npm
npm start


# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npx react-native run-android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
 npx react-native run-ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

### Creating User

Register from the app, and then use the same information to log in later. it will create a entry in User collection.
use '\_id' field to map Jobs with the user.

### Config

Use sync.config.js to setup **AppID** and **OpenAI API Url**.
