# Amazon Bedrock

This solution uses two models provided by Bedrock, the Titan Embeddings G1 to generate embeddings and Titan Text G1 - Lite to answer questions.

## Model Access

Before you can use the LLMs provided by Bedrock, you'll need to request for access to them.

To request access to the required two titan models, open up Model Access from the side menu.

Request to most models, including the two we'll use, should be granted fairly quickly.
